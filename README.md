ðŸ“– About This Project
This is an open-source, deployable "starter kit" that empowers a single FaithTech city (like FaithTech Adelaide) or an entire FaithTech Region (like FaithTech Australia) to launch a powerful, brand-aligned website in minutes.

The Core Problem
Local FaithTech groups need a public-facing website to build community, showcase projects, and attract new members. Currently, they face two major hurdles:

The Central Bottleneck: Using the global faithtech.com site can be slow and lacks local customisation.

The Technical Hurdle: Building a new site from scratch is a massive technical burden for volunteers and leads to brand fragmentation.

The Solution: A Flexible, "One-Click Hub"
This project solves both problems. It's a "batteries-included" template that a volunteer can deploy once with a single click.

During setup, you choose your model:

Single City Mode: Run a simple, powerful website for just your city.

Region Mode: Run a "regional hub" and manage websites for all your local cities (e.g., Adelaide, Sydney, Melbourne) from one dashboard.

This starter kit comes pre-packaged with all the essential features:

FaithTech "CREATE" Project showcases: A dedicated space for your local projects.

Event & Member Management: A complete system for scheduling events, managing RSVPs, and handling user profiles.

Blog Engine: A built-in blog to post news and updates.

Newsletter Tools: Manage subscriber lists for your community updates.

Brand Alignment: All pages are built with a shared component library to ensure 100% brand consistency.

This project is built on a powerful runtime plugin architecture, allowing any developer in the FaithTech community to safely build and share new features (like forums or proximity chat) that any hub can add to their site.
