## The Problem

Local FaithTech communities worldwide face a common challenge: they need a powerful, brand-aligned website to build community, showcase projects, and attract new members. Currently, they encounter two major barriers:

1. **The Central Bottleneck**: Using the global faithtech.com site is slow, lacks local customization, and requires coordination with the global team
2. **The Technical Burden**: Building a custom site from scratch is a massive undertaking for volunteer-led communities, leading to:
   - Inconsistent branding across regions
   - Fragmented tech stacks that can't be shared
   - Duplicated effort (every city reinvents the same features)
   - High maintenance costs and volunteer burnout

## The Vision

**Every FaithTech community in the world can deploy a powerful, brand-aligned regional hub in under 60 minutes.**

This is not just a website template. This is:
- A **stable, extensible platform** that grows with communities
- A **global developer ecosystem** where FaithTech technologists contribute features that benefit all cities
- A **reference implementation** showing how to build faith-centered tech with excellence
- A **catalyst for collaboration** across the worldwide FaithTech network

## The "Stone Soup" Strategy

We're following the Pragmatic Programmer's "Stone Soup" approach:

> **Build something compelling enough that others want to add their own ingredients.**

**Phase 1: The Foundation Stone**
- Ship a working multi-city regional hub for **FaithTech Australia**
- Include the features 90% of cities need: Events, Projects, Blog, Newsletter
- Architecture is clean, modular, and extensible (even without full plugin system)
- **Goal:** Demonstrate "this is possible and it works"

**Phase 2 (Post-Launch): Community Ingredients**
- Global FaithTech developers see the foundation and want to contribute
- Build the plugin SDK (`@faithtech/sdk`) so contributors can add features safely
- Launch vetted plugin marketplace (forums, proximity chat, integrations)
- **Goal:** Ecosystem of community-built features

**Phase 3 (Long-term): Global Adoption**
- Plugins are shared across regions (e.g., a developer in Nigeria builds a feature that Sydney uses)
- FaithTech becomes a model for how global faith-tech communities operate
- **Goal:** Worldwide impact through open collaboration

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 (Initial Release)
- ✅ FaithTech Australia launches with 3+ cities (Adelaide, Sydney, Melbourne)
- ✅ Regional admin can create cities and assign admins in under 15 minutes
- ✅ City admins can create events, publish projects, write blog posts
- ✅ Public-facing site is SEO-optimized and brand-compliant
- ✅ Codebase is clean enough that external contributors can understand it

### Phase 2 (Community Phase)
- ✅ Plugin SDK is published and documented
- ✅ First community-built plugin is vetted and added to marketplace
- ✅ Active contributor community forms (Discord/Slack engagement)

### Phase 3 (Global Scale)
- ✅ 20+ community-built plugins available
- ✅ Platform is self-sustaining (community maintains it)
- ✅ Other faith-tech organizations adopt the model

## What This Is NOT

To prevent scope creep, explicit boundaries:

❌ **Not a SaaS business** - This is open-source infrastructure for the FaithTech community
❌ **Not a CMS competitor** - We're not trying to replace WordPress/Webflow for general use
❌ **Not a social network** - We're focused on organizational websites, not peer-to-peer networking
❌ **Not enterprise software** - We optimize for volunteer-led communities, not corporations
❌ **Not "build everything"** - We integrate with existing tools (Mailchimp, Circle) rather than reinventing them

## Why This Matters Beyond "Just a Website"

This project represents:

1. **Excellence in Faith-Tech**: Demonstrating that faith-driven projects can have world-class architecture and developer experience
2. **Global Collaboration Model**: Showing how distributed volunteer communities can build sophisticated software together
3. **Multiplication Effect**: One developer building a plugin impacts hundreds of members worldwide
4. **Stewardship**: Using technical skills to serve the global Church and its mission

## Call to Action

### For FaithTech Australia (Primary Stakeholders)
- **Phase 1:** Dogfood the platform, provide feedback, iterate rapidly
- **Post-Launch:** Be the reference customer that proves this works
- **Ongoing:** Share learnings with other regions, inspire adoption

### For FaithTech Developers
- **Now:** Watch the repo, understand the architecture, prepare to contribute
- **Phase 2:** Build plugins that extend the platform
- **Ongoing:** Help maintain the core, review PRs, support other contributors

### For Other FaithTech Regions
- **Now:** Follow along, provide input on what features you need
- **Phase 1 Launch:** Consider deploying for your region
- **Ongoing:** Share plugins your developers build, contribute back improvements

## The Bigger Picture

This is more than infrastructure. It's about:
- **Unity**: One shared platform instead of fragmented solutions
- **Stewardship**: Building once, sharing everywhere
- **Excellence**: Demonstrating technical quality honors God
- **Mission**: Empowering local communities to thrive and grow

Let's build something worthy of the global FaithTech movement.
